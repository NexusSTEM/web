                    <p style="margin-top: -20px;"><strong>How often should my lawn be fertilized?</strong> For optimal health, we recommend fertilizing your lawn every 6-8 weeks during the growing season. Our team can create a customized fertilization schedule based on your lawn's specific needs.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: -20px;"><strong>What types of plants do you recommend for low-maintenance gardens?</strong> We recommend native and drought-resistant plants for low-maintenance gardens, as they require less water and care. Our garden design experts can suggest the best plants based on your preferences and local climate.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: -20px;"><strong>How long does it take to complete a landscaping project?</strong> The timeline for a landscaping project varies depending on the scope and complexity. Typically, garden designs and smaller installations can be completed in a few days, while larger projects like patios and hardscaping may take several weeks. We'll provide a detailed timeline during your consultation.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: -20px;"><strong>Can I request a custom garden or landscape design?</strong> Absolutely!
